## Activity

Each of you have been given a 3x5 index card. On the card write the following, you will have 10 minutes. 

1. Your Name
1. What school you attend
1. What you hope to learn this weekend
1. Something in your every day life that uses computer code that you could not live without

When asked to do so, pass your card to the person to your right. If you are at the end of the row, your card goes to the first person on the left of the row behind you. If you are in the back right, your card goes to the first person in the front left. 

Now, we will go around the room and you will introduce the person on your card.
